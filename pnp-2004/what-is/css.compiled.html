<h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Basically CSS is a language used to style or format web pages.  It can add color, move or resize page elements, add and control backgrounds, and more.  (To see the difference CSS can make, check out the <a title="The pages shows HTML with and without CSS, to ilustrate the difference it can make." href="/demo/">demo</a>.)
</p>
<p>CSS is the language no web developer should be without.  It was created by the <!--<a href="/what-is/w3c.html" title="What is the W3C?" class="definition">-->W3C<!--</a>--> (<a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="W3C home page">www.w3.org</a>) to halt <!--<a href="/what-is/html.html" title="What is HTML?" class="definition">-->HTML<!--</a>-->'s continued bloating.  Originally, HTML did not style web pages, but during the "browser wars," it began to include minimal styling attributes.  HTML was never able to handle certain layouts.  However, CSS gives the web designer near-total control over display of the website, as well as <a href="http://www.bigbaer.com/css_tutorials/css.image.text.wrap.htm">freedom from table-based layouts</a>.  Additionally, and to Pixels &amp; Pages the coolest part, is that if your all your web pages reference one CSS file, you can change the way your whole website works by editing that CSS file.  That's a whole lot easier and less time-consuming than changing every page by itself!
